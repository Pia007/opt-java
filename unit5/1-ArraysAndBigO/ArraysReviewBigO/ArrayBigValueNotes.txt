Retrieving an elemement from an array
1. Multiply the size of the element by its index
2. Ge the start address of the array
3. Add the start address to the result of the multiplication


For an int array, assume elements start at address 12. Each byte is 4 bytes
intArray[0] = 12 + 0 * 4 = 12
intArray[1] = 12 + 1 * 4 = 16
intArray[2] = 12 + 2 * 4 = 20
intArray[3] = 12 + 3 * 4 = 24

Regardless of the number of elements in the array it will take 2 steps to retrieve the element
Thus O(1) constant time complexity - bc the number of steps is constant as the number of element increases the algo does not degrade
