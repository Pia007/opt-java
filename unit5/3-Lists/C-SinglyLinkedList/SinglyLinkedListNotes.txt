LINKED LIST
    - sequential list of objects
    - no arrays
    - each item in the list is aware o f another item in the list
        - each item contains a link to the next item in the list
    - in an array each item is unaware of the other
    - each item is called a node
        - node has 2 parts
            - field for the data
            - next field of type node
    - the first item is the head of the list
        - if you have a reference to the head, can traverse the entire list until null
        - only have to store a ref to the head
    - Java has a linked list class

    How to insert an item?
        - Create a new node
        - assign the head to the next field ref
        - assign the new node to the head
        - will be O(1) time complexity
    Delete?
        - assign the node to be removed to a temp variable
        - assign the next ref of the head to te head
        - return the temp variable
        -O(1)
