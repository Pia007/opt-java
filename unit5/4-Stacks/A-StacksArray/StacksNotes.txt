STACKS
    - abstract data type
    - dictate operations, behavior
    - LIFO. thus no random access
    - push - adds an item as the top item on the stack
    - pop - removes the tio item on the stack
    - peek - gets the top item on the stack without popping it
    - can be backed by any data structure
        - ideal backing data structure: linked list ( add and remove from front of list)
Time Complexity
    - depends on what data structure is being used to back the stack
        - linked list
            -- push, pop and peek will be constant time O(1)
        - array
            -- O(n) because the array will need to be resized
            -- ideal when max num of items is known or when memory is tight
