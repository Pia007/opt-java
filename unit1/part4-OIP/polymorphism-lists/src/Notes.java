// Polymorphism fom classes that implement lists
// //many collection types use the list interface
    //ArrayList and LinkedList can take the form of the interface they implement

//list - interface that defines methods required from a class
// ArrayList class implements the List interface
    // will override all of the list methods
    // ex. toArray
//LinkedList is another collection type that implements Lists
    // will be forced to override  methods

//ArrayList vs LinkedList
    // linklist has bad performance - has to go through every elem until it gets to n
    //arraylist has direct ref to every elem, thus faster

//interfaces allow for polymorphism
    // arraylist implement the list interface..can declare the object as type list
