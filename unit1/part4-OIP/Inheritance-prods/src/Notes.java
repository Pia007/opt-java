// Inheritance makes code reusable
    // Shirt and pants need to inherit from a Parent class
    // they share similar fields
        // instead of defining fields for each class
            // should inherit common fields from a parent class
    // they are children of the Product class
// in models create Product.java
    //define fields that shirt and pants have in common
        //then remove them from the shirt and pants fields and the constructors
        // also remove the same getters
   // a class that extends another class inherits from it
    // shirt and pants extend the Product class
        // now add extend to the shirt and pants classes
    //*Main confirm by creating an object of the shirt class
//super
