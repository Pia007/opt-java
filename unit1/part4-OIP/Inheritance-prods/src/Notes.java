// Inheritance makes code reuable
    // Shirt and pants need to inherit from a Parent class
    // they share similar fields
        // instead of defining fields for each class
            // should inherit common fields from a parent class
    // they are children of the Product class
// in models create Product.java
    //define fields that shirt and pants have in common
