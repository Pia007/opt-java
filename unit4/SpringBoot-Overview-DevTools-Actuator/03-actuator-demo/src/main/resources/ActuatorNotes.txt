SPRING BOOT ACTUATOR
 -- exposes endpoints to monitor and manage application
 -- check health
 -- access application metrics
 HOW? add dependency to POM file
    -- rest endpoints will automatically be added to your application
    -- no need to write additional code, free endpoints to use
    -- all endpoints are prefixed with /actuator
        -- /health: app health info, status, customizable, exposed by default
            localhost:8080/actuator/health
        -- /info: project info, empty by default, exposed by default
           -- must customize, must details as you like
           How? update application.properties
           -- info.app.name=My Spring App
              info.app.description=A sample Spring Boot App
              info.app.version=1.0.0
           localhost:8080/actuator/info
 more Actuator endpoint examples, 10+
 /auditevents - audit events for your app
 /beans - list of all beans registered in the Spring app context
 /mappings - List of all @RequestMappings paths

 To expose all the actuator endpoints over HTTP, add the code below to applications.properties
    -- can use wildcard "*" to expose all
    -- can expose individual; endpoints with a comma-delimited list
    (NOV 2021 UPDATE)
        management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=heath,info
        management.info.env.enabled=true
Process to use Actuator
1. edit POM file to add spring-boot-starter-actuator
2. view actuator endpoint: health and info(must customize)

*************************************************
SPRING SECURITY
 MUST BE CAREFUL TO USE SECURITY MEASURES TO KEEP THE ACTUATORS FROM BEING EXPOSED

Secure endpoints
Spring Security - will require login
    Default username = user
    Default password =  IS in the console

Override Defaults - application.properties
spring.security.user.name=<username>
spring.security.user.password=<password>

Customizing Spring Security for actuator
-- use db for roles, encrypt passwords etc..
1. Set up a Security config
2. Override configure
3. auth.jdbcAuthentication
4. authorize on request for matchers on a given endpoint

Exclude Endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=heath,info

Process
1. edit POM file - rebuild app then rerun, check console for pwd
2. verify security on endpoints -- ex) actuator/mappings
    NOTE ALL ENDPOINTS REQUIRE INITIAL LOGIN
3. disable endpoints
