SPRING BOOT ACTUATOR
 -- exposes endpoints to monitor and manage application

 HOW? add dependency to POM file
    -- rest endpoints will automatically be added to your application
    -- no need to write additional code, free endpoints to use
    -- all endpoints are prefixed with /actuator
        -- /health: app health info, status, customizable, exposed by default
            localhost:8080/actuator/health
        -- /info: project info, empty by default, exposed by default
           -- must customize, must details as you like
           How? update application.properties
           -- info.app.name=My Spring App
              info.app.description=A sample Spring Boot App

 /auditevents - audit events for your app
 /beans - list of all beans registered in the Spring app context

 To expose all the actuator endpoints over HTTP, add the code below to applications.properties
    -- can use wildcard "*" to expose all
    -- can expose individual; endpoints with a comma-delimited list
    (NOV 2021 UPDATE)
        management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=heath,info
        management.info.env.enabled=true
